## General Information
   This company is the largest online loan marketplace, facilitating personal loans, business loans, and financing of medical procedures. Borrowers can easily access lower interest rate loans through a fast online interface. Like most other lending companies, lending loans to ‘risky’ applicants is the largest source of financial loss (called credit loss). Credit loss is the amount of money lost by the lender when the borrower refuses to pay or runs away with the money owed. In other words, borrowers who default cause the largest amount of loss to the lenders. In this case, the customers labelled as 'charged-off' are the 'defaulters'.

## Conclusions
Major Driving factor which can be used to predict the chance of defaulting and avoiding Credit Loss:
DTI
Grades
Verification Status
Annual income
Pub_rec_bankruptcies
Other considerations for 'defaults' :
Burrowers from large urban cities like california, new york, texas, florida etc.
Burrowers having annual income in the range 50000-100000.
Burrowers having Public Recorded Bankruptcy.
Burrowers with least grades like E,F,G which indicates high risk.
Burrowers with very high Debt to Income value.
Burrowers with working experience 10+ years.
